"Those ants have done it again. Destroyed all of the elevators in the office block they have. Gah! And to top it off, they've infested the building with dozens of jammer robots to prevent you from cleaning the place up. What a mess! Despite all of that, we're sending you in Buddy. Get those elevators fixed so our workers can get back to business." - Your Boss.

You are Buddy, a repair robot sent into the bosses office block to repair the elevators floor by floor.

CONTROLS:

WASD or ARROW KEYS to move.

Q, E, or F to interact with doors.


GOAL:
Collect cogs on each level to unlock the elevator to the next. Keep progressing for as long as possible but beware as the floors are jam packed with jammer robots ready to ruin your boss' day!
